# Functional Requirements

**Data Loading:** *System needs to load files properly and without issues, and fix any existent issues itself.*

**Data Cleaning:** *The system will need to be able to use the data and filter, sort and group it. The system will also need to be able to fix/remove missing or incorrect values.*

**Data Analysis:** *The system should be able to calculate median, mode and mean.*

**Data Visualisation:** *The system will need to use MatPlotLib charts to display data.*

**Data Reporting:** *The system will store the final dataset in a .csv file.*

# Non Functional Requirements

**Usability:** *In the User Interface, I will aim for some sort of visual interface for the user to utilize. At the very minimum, the system will have a User Interface that is text based. In the README document, each lesson's progress will be documented inside, along with any work I do outside of class.*

**Reliability:** *When supplying the system with information, there will be no leaks, corruption or loss of data. The data given will stay only with the system and user.*
