**STATE your point.**
*Clearly state the concept or idea you're trying to communicate. Make sure it's brief and to the point.*                                                                                                                                                                        
The rising cost of living in Australia is making it more difficult for many people to afford basic items, leading to a widely spread financial strain across different types of households.                                                                                     

**ELABORATE on that Statement.** 
*Explain it in your own words, as if you're talking to a friend who's unfamiliar with the topic.*                                                                                                                                                                               
Over the past few years, many Australians have faced increasing expenses in areas such as rent, groceries, insurance, and energy bills. To implement data, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has stated that most household types are seeing cost increases throughout 2024, with employee households seeing the largest rise in costs with a 6.2% increase annually. It has eased slightly, but prices are still climbing, and wages have not been increased to match the cost of living. This results in an imbalance between costs and payment.
