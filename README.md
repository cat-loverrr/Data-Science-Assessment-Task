# Lesson 1 - 22/07/2025
In this lesson, I have been focusing on finding a wicked problem to work on. My initial possibilities were the inflation of supermarkets in Australia, and the overall cost of living in Australia. I have settled on picking the overall cost of living in Australia, which will include the overall increase of pricing, along with more in depth sections, such as regional statistics, and different sections such as electricity, fruit and vegetables, and medical services.
The question will be "Can people afford to stay in Australia with the increased cost of living?"

# Lesson 2 - 25/7/2025
This lesson, I am continuing to work on Phase 1, specifically the Requirements Outline.
---------- HALFWAY THROUGH THE LESSON UPDATE -----------
So far, I have identified most of the functional requirements. I will begin on non-functional requirements, and I am hoping to finish Phase 1 so I can commence onto Phase 2 by next lesson.
