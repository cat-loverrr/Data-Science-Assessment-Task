## Lesson 1 - 22/07/2025
In this lesson, I have been focusing on finding a wicked problem to work on. My initial possibilities were the inflation of supermarkets in Australia, and the overall cost of living in Australia. I have settled on picking the overall cost of living in Australia, which will include the overall increase of pricing, along with more in depth sections, such as regional statistics, and different sections such as electricity, fruit and vegetables, and medical services.
**The question will be "Can people afford to stay in Australia with the increased cost of living?"**

## Lesson 2 - 25/7/2025
This lesson, I am continuing to work on Phase 1, specifically the Requirements Outline.                                                                                                     
**---------- HALFWAY THROUGH THE LESSON UPDATE, 12:58 PM -----------**                                                                                                                                    
So far, I have identified most of the functional requirements. I will begin on non-functional requirements, and I am hoping to finish Phase 1 so I can commence onto Phase 2 by next lesson.                                                                                                          
**----------  NEAR THE END OF THE LESSON UPDATE, 1:21 PM ----------**                                                                                    
I have finished everything in Phase 1, except the the mind map, which I will get on to soon. [The Requirements Outline](https://github.com/cat-loverrr/Data-Science-Assessment-Task/blob/main/requirements_outline.md) is finished and stored in a seperate markdown (.md) file. I have finalised that file by making it more aesthetically pleasing, with italicisation, bolding, and headings. I will now move on to Phase 2 next lesson.                                                                                                           
**---------- FINAL PUBLISHING TIME, END OF LESSON 2, 1:28 PM ----------**

## Lesson 3 - 28/072025
This lesson, I will begin on Phase 2. The first step of Phase 2 is researching the issue, so I will begin to find items such as news articles on the issue. Links found on the issue -

## Lesson 4 - 01/08/2025
This lesson, I will continue researching the problem, compiling more links, and then getting started on the SEE-I paragraph/s.                                                                                                                                                
**---------- UPDATE, 11:52 AM ----------**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
I've finished with finding a lot of news articles, and anything else that has appropriate information to the task. I'm now re-reading everything written on this md document to ensure there's not any mistakes. I will also get started on the SEE-I paragraph/s.            
**---------- SEE-I PARAGRAPHS ----------**
The paragraphs are stored in another markdown (.md) file. You can find it [here.](https://github.com/cat-loverrr/Data-Science-Assessment-Task/blob/main/SEE-I%20paragraphs.md)
I have began the SEE-I paragraph, and will finish it next lesson.                                                                        

## Lesson 5 - 05/08/2025
I've finished the [SEE-I paragraph](https://github.com/cat-loverrr/Data-Science-Assessment-Task/blob/main/SEE-I%20paragraphs.md).
I am now looking through Kaggle to find some datasets relevant to [my research question.](Data-Science-Assessment-Task/Research Question.md at main Â· cat-loverrr/Data-Science-Assessment-Task)
