***Evaluate your system and results in relation to your [Requirements Outline.](https://github.com/cat-loverrr/Data-Science-Assessment-Task/blob/main/requirements_outline.md)***
My code loads the files properly, and without errors. There has been multiple instances in which I have cleaned the data, and should fix any values that are wrong. Matplotlib is used in this code, being able to create visualisations. There are also seperate csv files for both of the datasets. There is a well guided user interface that the user can apply in order to find their way through the program and use it efficiently. Everything stays within the file/dataset, and does not go anywhere else, as it is only stored through the csv files.
